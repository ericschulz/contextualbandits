     <p>We would like to invite you to participate in this research project. You should only participate if you want to; choosing not to take part will not disadvantage you in any way. Before you decide whether you want to take part, it is important for you to read the following information carefully and discuss it with others if you wish. Ask us if there is anything that is not clear or you would like more information.</p>
     <p>We are investigating how people learn in new environments. In this study you will perform a simple computer task called <font color="green"><b>"Space Mining".</b></font></p>
     <p>The study should not take longer than 20 minutes. Upon completion of the study, you will be paid a basic fee of $ 0.3 and an additional bonus between 0 and $ 0.5 depending on your perfomarnce. In order to qualify for the credit and bonus you need to finish the study.</p>
     <p>All data will be handled according to the Data Protection Act 1998. All responses are treated as confidential and anonymous. All data will be pooled and published in aggregate form only. Only Manos Konstantinidis and researchers working with him will have access to these data. </p>
     <p>It is up to you to decide whether or not to take part. If you choose not to participate it will involve no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled. If you decide to take part you are still free to withdraw at any time and without providing a reason.</p>

   <p><b>Please read the following instructions very carefully: </b></p>
   <br>
   <p> Welcome to <font color="green" FACE="bookman">SPACE MINING</font>. You are a MINER working in outer space. It is your task to mine as many <font color="green">EMERALDS</font> as you can from 4 different planets. Emeralds are important for mankind to produce energy for transportation and computers.</p>
   <p> You will see 4 different planets: "PLANET 1", "PLANET 2", "PLANET 3", and "PLANET 4" and it will be your task to choose one planet where you want to mine for Emeralds on each trial. Because it is hard to mine Emeralds, you can only always mine one planet at a given round.</p>
   <p>Additionally, you will also see 3 different environmental factors: "MECURY", "KRYPTON", and "NOBELIUM". These factors describe the galaxy at the given day when you are about to mine. Each of those factors can either be on, marked by a "+", or off, marked by a "-". The factors of the galaxy on a given day influence how many Emeralds you can mine from each planet.</p>
   <p>It is therefore your task to learn how the different factors related to the potential number of Emeralds for each planet and then to choose the planet that you think will have the highest number of Emeralds.
   <p> Different planets might respond differently to the environmental factors of the galaxy. For example, "MERCURY" could be good for one Planet but bad for an other. It can also happen that a field produces Emeralds independently of how much "MERCURY" there is. It is your task to learn how the different PLANETS react to the environmental conditions and pick the best PLANET on each round accordingly.</p> 
   <p>You have a total amount of 150 trials available. That means you have <b>150</b> chances to click on a PLANET and mine the Emeralds of that planet. It is your task to choose the planet wisely, so that you first get a good feeling for planet is influenced by what environmental factor and how, but also to find the best planet for the given environmental factors as quickly as possible in order to maximize the number of Emeralds overall.</p>
   <p>Even though the number of Emeralds are direclty related to the environmental factors, there is some variation in every round. This means that the mined number of Emeralds for each field can vary slightly and are not always the same. It is your task to determine how much they can vary. The way they vary is the same across all of the plabets, which means that you will not encounter big deviations for one planet and small deviations at others.</p> 
   <p>On the next page, you will see a short example. This example is designed so you get used to the structure of the task and does not count towards your performance assessment. The dependency of mined Emeralds in this example is very simple and not representative of the dependency in the actual task.</p>

  <p> <b>Explanation:</b></p><br>
  <p><b>I.</b> Below you see 4 different Planets. The Planets are described by three different galactic environments on each trial. The environments will influence how many Emeralds a Planet will yield.</p>
  <p><b>II.</b> It is your task to learn how the different environmental factors influence the expected number of Emeralds on each planet and choose the planet you think will produce the highest number of Emeralds. </p>
  <p><b>III.</b> The number of mined Emeralds will be displayed once you clicked on a Planet.</p>
  <p><b>IV.</b> On top of the task, you can see how many investigations you have left and the total number of Emeralds mined so far.</p>
  <p><b>V.</b> Remember, it is your task to maximize the output of Emeralds over time by choosing planets wisely. This basically means learning how the different planets respond to different environmental factors and choosing the planet you think will produce the most Emerald given the current conditions.</p>
  <p><b>VI.</b> Remember that different planet might respond differently to the environmental factors. What is good for one planet could be bad for another and vice versa. It can also happen that a planet is indifferent to a environmental factor, meaning that it can produce Emeralds independent of it.</p>
  <p><b>VII.</b> You have 150 investigations in total. Please try to mine as many Emeralds as possible.</p>
  <p><b>VIII.</b> After you have clicked on a Planet, you have to click on the "Next trial"-Button to continue with the next trial.</p>
